## Hi I'm Junx üëã

I gradually realized the need for a platform to record the knowledge I have accumulated at work, as well as the content I learn privately; 
There is no doubt that **GitHub** is such a platformÔºÅ

Plan to establish the following code repository for recording.
- Embedded: Record the knowledge accumulation of an embedded engineer.
- Basic Skills: The Missing Semester Of Your CS Education
- Math: Mathematics is the cornerstone of many professional courses and algorithms, and it is also my interest from a young age.
- Electronic: My undergraduate major.
